CS 255 Portfolio project


This project was an exercise in applying system design concepts to the theoretical use case. The client wanted a web-based deployment of their DMV training business. 

I think that the UML class diagram accurately models how the system would manage objects.

The nonfunctional requirements seemed to be frequently on the functional side, due to the nature of the interview, and one sided information presented about customer requirements.

The customer gave only brief functional needs of the system, and left the nonfunctional side a bit lacking, and open to interpretation.

I typically use the accurate probing of specific needs to assist in system and software design. We really need the customer to tell us what they need, and in an accurate and specific format.
